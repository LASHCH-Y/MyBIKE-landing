Technologies Used:

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
Purpose: HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the basic structure of the website and organizes content into elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
Usage: In this project, HTML is used to define the layout of the landing page, including sections for the header, main content, product details, and contact form. Semantic tags help enhance accessibility and SEO.

- SCSS (Sassy CSS):
Purpose: SCSS is a preprocessor for CSS that extends the language with additional features such as variables, nested rules, and mixins, making it easier to write and maintain styles.
Usage: SCSS is used in this project to create a consistent and efficient styling framework. It helps manage complex styles by organizing them into reusable components, applying themes, and enabling easier modifications through variables.

- JavaScript:
Purpose: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.
Usage: In this project, JavaScript is used to implement animations that occur when elements appear in the viewport as the user scrolls. The Intersection Observer API is leveraged to trigger CSS animations, enhancing the user experience.

- Google Fonts:
Purpose: Google Fonts is a library of web fonts that can be easily integrated into web projects to improve typography.
Usage: The Poppins font is imported from Google Fonts to ensure a modern and visually appealing text style that aligns with the site's design.

- Responsive Design Techniques:
Purpose: Ensure the website looks good and functions well on a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Usage: Media queries and flexible grid layouts are used to adapt the layout and styles for different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on all devices.


These technologies together create a robust, visually appealing, and interactive landing page that effectively showcases the bicycle brand and engages users.
